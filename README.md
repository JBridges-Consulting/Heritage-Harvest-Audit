CPG Agentic Workflows Portfolio

Bridging Retail Strategy and Autonomous AI
This portfolio demonstrates a multi-agent ecosystem designed to automate the lifecycle of a CPG product—from internal knowledge management to retail shelf execution. Each agent is built to solve a specific business problem: Data Silos, Financial Leakage, and Market Blind Spots.

🤖 The Four Agents

Agent 1: The CPG Knowledge Concierge 

The Problem: Sales teams waste hours searching through 100+ page distributor manuals and trade policy PDFs.
The Solution: A RAG-powered (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) assistant that provides instant, cited answers to complex operational questions.
Key Tech: PDF Parsing, Vector Embeddings, Semantic Search.

Agent 2: The Trade Spend & Margin Auditor

The Problem: "Price gaps" and incorrect trade spend entries can erode margins by 5-10% before they are even noticed.
The Solution: An automated financial auditor that syncs with Google Sheets to verify SKU-level margins against a strict 50% "Safety Floor."
Key Tech: Google Sheets API, Financial Logic Engines, Automated Email (SMTP) alerts.

Agent 3: The Retail Signal Monitor

The Problem: "Out-of-Sight, Out-of-Mind." Brands lose millions when products are out-of-stock or mispriced on the shelf.
The Solution: "I make AI watch the market so humans don't have to." A Vision-AI tool that analyzes shelf photos to detect stock-outs and pricing violations.
Key Tech: Gemini 1.5 Flash Vision, Multimodal AI, Image Processing.

Agent 4: The Autonomous JBP Strategist

The Problem: Creating a Joint Business Plan (JBP) with a retailer takes weeks of data synthesis.
The Solution: An executive-level orchestrator that pulls data from the first three agents to generate winning retail strategies and promotional roadmaps.

Key Tech: Data Synthesis, Predictive Strategy, LLM Orchestration.
